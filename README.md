You can look at the code and copy bits of it, but please don't take the idea or copy the code without my permission. You can email me at [nathan.r.wang@gmail.com](mailto:nathan.r.wang@gmail.com).

This is for a school science project, so the code is very messy and unmaintatinable as it's a small 1-week project. Bugs and bad code consistency will exist. Use at your own risk.

**Note:** You need to add a music.mp3 file and a button-click.mp3 file into the media/ folder. The music.mp3 is the background music file. The button-click.mp3 is the sound effect played when a button is clicked.
